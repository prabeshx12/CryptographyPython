<h1>This will be about Cryptography, Networking and Security</h1>

<h2>Day 1</h2>
<h3>Substitution Cipher</h3>
<h4>
1. Caesar Cipher(+3) --> A becomes D, B becomes E and so on.

<h3>Morse Code</h3>
<h4>
1. WIll change numbers letters into dots(.) and dashes(_).</h4>

<h2>Day 2</h2>
<h3>Hashing Algorithm</h3
<h4>
Properties:
1. should be fast but not so fast.
2. shouldn't have hash collisions.
3. has kind of like avalanche effect. i.e. changing in one bit changes the whole hash value. 

Types of Hashing Algorithms:
1. SHA(Secure Hash Algorithms) -> various versions are there such as SHA-1, SHA-2, etc.
2. MD5(Message Digest 5) -> broken
</h4>
<h4>
   SHA-1:<br>
   -> 160 bits long hash values means 32 bits each for 5 message<br>
   -> Bears similarity with MD5 and MD4 in functioning.
